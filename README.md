PowerVim is a hard fork of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), which is a Neovim setup
powered by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, PowerVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.

PowerVim differs from LazyVim in how it is configured and how add-ons are managed.
