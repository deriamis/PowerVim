GeekVim is a Neovim setup powered by [ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, GeekVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.

GeekVim is hard fork of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
and differs from LazyVim in how it is configured and how add-ons are managed. For the
time being, almost all of the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/)
is relevant to GeekVim except for plugin management, and patches will be ported as
deemed appropriate. However, there is no guarantee of ongoing parity because, as
previously stated, GeekVim is a hard fork.
